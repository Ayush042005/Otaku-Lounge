# Otaku-Lounge

Hey there, and welcome to the Otaku Lounge! This is a cool little spot I built so anime fans can hang out and chat about their favorite shows.

You'll find a bunch of anime cards here, and each one has its own chat room. The best part? The chats are saved in real-time, so you can pick up the conversation whenever you come back!

## What's Under the Hood?

-   **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-   **Back-End:** Node.js, Express.js
-   **Real-Time Communication:** WebSockets (`ws` library)
-   **Database:** A simple `db.json` file managed with `lowdb` for easy setup.

## Wanna Run This on Your Machine?

Hereâ€™s how you can get it set up.

1.  **First things first:** You'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

2.  **Grab the code:** Clone this repository to get a copy of the project on your machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/otaku-lounge.git](https://github.com/your-username/otaku-lounge.git)
    cd otaku-lounge
    ```
    *(Just don't forget to swap `your-username` with your actual GitHub username!)*

3.  **Install the goodies:** Open up your terminal in the project folder and type this in. It'll install everything the project needs to run.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Fire it up!** To get the server started, just run this command:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5.  **Check it out:** That's it! Just open your browser and head over to `http://localhost:3000`.

You should see the site up and running. Have fun chatting!
